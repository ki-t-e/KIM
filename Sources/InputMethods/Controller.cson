# This keymap maps a number of commonly-used controls to keyboard characters, for easier input in interactive applications which do not require text keyboard input.
# The arrow keys are mapped to IJKL and the various messages are mapped to QAZSXWUO;.
# BOOT, RESUME, PAUSE, and HALT are mapped to the digits 1 through 4, but only when the Shift key is held.

# Note that on a KiBoard, these controls are also hardcoded into the function (Escape; F1â€“F9) and arrow keys.
